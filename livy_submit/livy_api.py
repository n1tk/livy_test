        Submit a batch job to the Livy server

        Parameters
        ----------
        file : str
            The file that should be executed during your Spark job. This file
            path must be accessible from the nodes that run your Spark driver/executors.
            It is likely that this means that you will need to have pre-uploaded your file
            to hdfs and then use the hdfs path for this `file` variable.
            e.g.: file='hdfs://user/testuser/pi.py'
        name : str, optional
            The name that your Spark job should have on the Yarn RM. The supplied
            name must be unique for all known Livy jobs (starting, running, or completed) or
            a ValueError is thrown. If the name is not provided the job name will
            be listed as None in Livy and as the filename in the Yarn RM.
        driverMemory : str, optional
            e.g. 512m, 2g
            Amount of memory to use for the driver process, i.e. where
            SparkContext is initialized, in the same format as JVM memory
            strings with a size unit suffix ("k", "m", "g" or "t")
        driverCores : int, optional
             Number of cores to use for the driver process, only in cluster mode.
        executorMemory : str, optional
            e.g. 512m, 2g
            Amount of memory to use per executor process, in the same format as
            JVM memory strings with a size unit suffix ("k", "m", "g" or "t")
        executorCores : int, optional
            The number of cores to use on each executor
        archives : List of strings
            Archives to be used in this session. Same deal as the `file` parameter. These
            archives likely need to already be uploaded to HDFS unless the files already
            exist on your Yarn nodes or if you have something like NFS available on all
            of the Yarn nodes.
        queue : str
            The YARN queue that your job should run in
        conf : dict
            Additonal spark configuration properties. Any valid variable listed in the
            spark configuration for your version of spark. See all here
            https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration.html
            e.g. {'spark.pyspark.python': '/opt/anaconda3/bin/python'}
        args : list of strings
            Extra command line args for the application. If your python main is expecting
            command line args, use this variable to pass them in.
        pyFiles: list of strings
            Python files to be used in this session. Same deal as the `file` parameter.
            These archives need to be already uploaded to HDFS.

        Returns
        -------
